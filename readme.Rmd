Explanation of my submission.
========================================================

Items submitted/uploaded:
1. A tidy data set in the form of a text file.
2. This Readme markdown file.
3. The run_analysis.R script that generates the tidy data.
4. The CodeBook markdown file.

========================================================

Explanation of run_analysis.R:
- step 1 - read in all pertinent files.
         - `features.txt` contains all variables names for test and train 
           data sets.  These will become the "descriptive variable names".
         - `activity.txt` contains the "descriptive activity names". They
           will later be merged with the data based on labels in the data.
- step 2 - use make.names() to create appropriate column names from features.
- step 3 - rbind() test and train data sets, and apply "descriptive activity
           names"
- step 4 - separately combine activity labels for test and train, as well
           as, the subject ids for test and train.
- step 5 - merge combined data set with "descriptive activity names".
- step 6 - subset only columns with "mean", "Mean", and "std".
         - the result of this step is the first data set required of the 
           project assignment.
- step 7 - use melt, ddply, and dcast to create a tidy data set with the 
           averages of each column variable for each combination subject
           and activity.
           The data is tidy because each column contains only one variable,
           and each row represents on observation (mean value).
         - This tidy is submitted as part of the assignment.
